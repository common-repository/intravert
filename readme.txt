Sell your own ad spaces and sponsorships. Integrate intravert ad spaces in your blog. 

== Description ==

We are helping creators, bloggers and entrepreneurs all around the world making more money through ethical, native ads.

Traditional advertisement solutions will display ads from their network, and give you a small portion of the profits. With Intravert for Wordpress, you can embed your own, unique, ethical and independent ad spaces, sell them, and keep the vast majority of profits.

We do not embed any tracking, cookies or pixel codes with our ad space. Everything is fully organic.

This plugin brings the functions of [https://intravert.co](https://intravert.co) to Wordpress, and makes it easy to serve and sell beautiful, natively integrated ad spaces on your blog. Claim your API key from [https://intravert.co](https://intravert.co) today, and serve your ad spaces automatically in your posts, anywhere you want as shortcodes and in your widget areas.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get my API key? =

API Keys can get claimed on [https://intravert.co/dashboard/integrations/](https://intravert.co/dashboard/integrations/).

= Where can I register? =

Registrations are open at [https://intravert.co/auth/signup/](https://intravert.co/auth/signup/)

= How does this work? =

You will be able to add and customize ad spaces through our platform and embed them on the platform. People will be able to purchase these spaces from you, and you will receive the payment directly after you approve the ad.

= How does this look? =

The ad spaces are fully customizable through our web platform and also by writing custom CSS. For a demo, take a look at [https://intravert.carrd.co/](https://intravert.carrd.co/).

= How will I get paid? =

We will ask you to connect a Stripe account to our backend. Payouts are being sent to your bank account automatically after that.

= Who will buy these ad spaces? =

Advertisers will traditionally come from your own community and see value in advertising their services on your site. We also offer a [marketplace](https://intravert.co/marketplace/) which will help you gain further visibility.

= Does this work? Why not use AdSense? =

Indeed, it does! AdSense is a huge network which splits profits. Out of that, AdSense takes a huge chunk too. Out of every ad campaign, you will only receive a payment of $1 - $5 per 1,000 impressions. If you sell your own, you keep a bigger chunk. Some of our publishers have experienced payouts more than 100x bigger than what they got through AdSense.

= How much does this cost? =

This is free! Once you receive and accept a booking, we will receive a small portion of that. If you don't get paid, we don't either. Check out [our website](https://intravert.co/) for more info.
